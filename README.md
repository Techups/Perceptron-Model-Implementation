# Perceptron-Model-Implementation
This is the implementation of the perceptron model on the iris dataset.
Here we have implemented a perceptron model to classify the iris dataset which you can see using "iris=datasets.load_iris()"
and then print(iris). 
The iris data set contains 3 species of flowers containing setosa, versicolor and verginica each containing 50. We need to predict 
whether they are correctly classified or not and if not classified how many are not classified properly using the Perceptron Model.

The Perceptron Model is a linear classifier so make sure that before using it on any data the data must be linear. Check the code 
for implementation.
